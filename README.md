# Puzzle-Sliding-Game
A puzzle sliding app for android developed for a university module on mobile development.

The puzzles require an internet connection to download the first time they are used. Puzzles will only be downloaded if they are clicked on to minimise data use.
Two lists of puzzles are maintained offline and online. The lists also include the highscore of completed puzzles and the size of any puzzle.

To solve a puzzle simply move the frames until the tiles until the image is whole. One or two tiles can be moved at once by clicking on the tile you wish to move or by making use of a short or long swipe in the direction you wish to move the tile.
The swipe is detected anywhere on the puzzle.

The tiles are hosted by Simon Grey as part of the mobile development module at Hull University.
